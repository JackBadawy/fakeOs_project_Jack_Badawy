# Welcome to my FakeOs project!

the goal of this project is to create a webpage the looks and functions like a computer desktop

### Goals

I will try to generate as much of the html as possible through JavaScript DOM interations.

The fake desktop will look like windows 95

icons will highligh upon click

double clicking on an icon will create a div to function as a program window
